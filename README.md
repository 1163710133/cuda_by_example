The SAD story is that these code only works in openGL 1.1. Be careful when using them.
I have tested under windows and everything is okay.
However it failed in the Ubuntu.

The CMake version of cuda_by_example,the origin code comes from:https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-example

CUDA by Example, written by two senior members of the CUDA software platform team, shows programmers how to employ this new technology. The authors introduce each area of CUDA development through working examples. After a concise introduction to the CUDA platform and architecture, as well as a quick-start guide to CUDA C, the book details the techniques and trade-offs associated with each key CUDA feature. Youâ€™ll discover when to use each CUDA C extension and how to write CUDA software that delivers truly outstanding performance.
